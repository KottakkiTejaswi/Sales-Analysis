# Sales-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to address real-world problems in data science. Through this project, I gained valuable insight into how data analysis can be used to gain useful insights.

The following questions will be addressed in this project:

Q. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

Q. What city had the highest number of sales?

Q. What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customers buying product?

Q. What products are most often sold together?

To answer these questions, the data needs to be arranged in such a way that we can easily analyse and get proper insights. Therefore, to achieve this we perform certain tasks. 

--> Merging 12 months of sales data into a single file

--> Clean up the data

     Drop rows of NAN
  
--> Augment data with additional columns

     Add Month column with the help of Order Date column
  
     Add Sales column
  
     Add City column

To get a more precise understanding of the results it is always better to represent them visually with the help of graphs. This helps us draw better conclusions.
